							<ul>
								<li>Core Java</li>
							</ul>
						<p>I have done my intenship in department itself. The internship was conducted by Ms. Guari Dessai, she is the ceo of thoughslate IT Solutions. It was a well organised program where I learnt about basics of Core Java. We learnt about creating class, object and various function of java. It was a interactive program where students were free to ask their query. We were asked to create a facebook login page.</p>
						<p id="more">It was 2 weeks program. Basically we started from scarch learning various packages and creating class and objects. Few mini projects were also given to us. For example class of office, school were created. And ended up having a final project that was creating a fackbook login page. It was indeed a great section, where I got to learn alot of things</p>

						<p>I have attended workshop conducted in department. It was a well organised program where I learnt about building of Antenna and various antenna used in our day to day life. We learnt about creating and planning of Antenna. It was a interactive program where students were free to ask their query.</p>
						<p id="more">It was 2 days workshop. Basically we started from scarch learning various Antenna and their structures. Few mini projects were also given to us. For example Half wave antenna, Yugi Huda Antenna were created. It was indeed a great section, where I got to learn alot of things</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Interfacing sensors and Line follower Robot using Arduino</li>
							</ul>
						<p>This workshop was conducted by our senior and it was in our department itself. It was a well organised program where I learnt about various Arduino and sensor. We learnt about building of Robot and Coding in Arduino Software. It was a interactive program where we asked queries.</p>
						<p id="more">It was 2 days workshop. Basically we started from scarch learning various Arduino and sensor used in our life and their application. Few mini projects were also given to us. We started with coding of motor, we made use of ultrasound sensor for detection and infra red sensor. Having seen all of this we moved to our final project that was line follower Robot. It was indeed a great section, where I got to learn alot of things</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Resonance</li>
							</ul>
							<p> This event was organised by our department in association with the Institution Of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. The event was conducted for 2 days. Having learnt about Arduino thought of participating in this event. Me and my fellow group members took part in mini project. We build a bot which used to detect obactles.</p>
							<p id="more"> We start our project weeks ago. We made use of arduino nano and ultrasound sensor which will detect the obactles. And surprisingly We won 2nd prize!!</p>
